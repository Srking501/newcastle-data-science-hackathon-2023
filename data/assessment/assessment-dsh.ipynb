    "abstract = {In this paper we propose using a novel big-data-mining methodology and the Internet as a new source of useful meta-data for industry classification. The proposed methodology can be utilised as a decision support system for identifying industrial clusters in almost real time in a specific geographic region, contributing to strategic co-operation and policy development for operations and supply chain management across organisational boundaries through big data analytics. Our theoretical discussion on discerning industrial activity of firms in geographical regions starts by highlighting the limitations of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. This discussion is followed by the proposed methodology, which has three main steps revolving around web-based data collection, pre-processing and analysis, and reporting of clusters. We discuss each step in detail, presenting the experimental approaches tested. We apply our methodology to a regional case, in the North East of England, in order to demonstrate how such a big data decision support system/analytics can work in practice. Implications for theory, policy and practice are discussed, as well as potential avenues for further research.}\n",

    "### Investigating the website of Elevate Greece Startup Database\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the website seems to have updated its information on startup. Since the start of the Data Science Hackathon, the dataset of startups were 700 now it is currently around 713 entries. Therefore, it is important to agree on a checkpoint of time where only that checkpoint of dataset will be retrieved for the hackathon.\n",

    "* **The website layout**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The webpage of [Elevate Greece Startup Database](https://elevategreece.gov.gr/startup-database) contains a table that displays by default 15 startup companies with clickable elements for the next 15 entries till the 713 entry. Therefore, a webscraper that could click on the elements to view each 15 entries till the 713 entry is needed to retrieve each of the tables content.\n",

    "\n",
    "    2. Clicking on one of the startup through the `Startup` column leads to the details of the startup company. However, this is the details that the startup company has provided to the Elevate Greece government sector, which follows Greece's SIC code. Thus, it is important to follow up the details with the company's respected website to gather up to date information.\n",

    "\n",
    "    3. Either clicking on the `Website` column link at the Elevate Greece table's startup database as shown above at bullet point 1 or clicking on `Startup` column as shown in bullet point 2 shows the startup company's website. Thus, this is one of the main sources to gather information on the startup companies.\n",
